# Haupcar Assessment - Flutter Git Demo

This is a sample Flutter mobile application for the Haupcar coding assessment. The project demonstrates the ability to build a functional app using Flutter, BLoC, RESTful API, and localization support.

This project follows the BLoC (Business Logic Component) pattern and Clean Architecture principle.

## Features

- Home page: Display a list of product categories.
- Product page: Show products under a selected category.
- Localization support (English, Thai, Myanmar) using Drawer menu (stored using shared_preferences).
- BLoC pattern used for state management.
- Responsive UI with Material Design.
- RESTful API integration with [dummyjson](https://dummyjson.com/).
- Pull-to-Refresh on category/product listings for real-time updates.
- Cached Images using cached_network_image to minimize repeated network calls and enhance performance.
